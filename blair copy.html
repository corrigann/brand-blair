    				</h2>
    			     <div class="half-width">
    				    <p> I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
    				    <p> That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

								<p>
									I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

									You can trust me to take a designer’s PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.
